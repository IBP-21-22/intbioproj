**Vassilis Ideas *expanding* previous team brainstorming:**

Subjects in my mind regarding protein aggregation and a bit of everything. I ve added a + sign at the end depending on the perceived difficulty, as well as subbranches, with them depending on parent.
( I know this stuff needs actual elaboration to sound even remotely doable, but they are ideas that may resonate with you all)

I keep bumping on the wall of exponential data in the following, so those ideas can only be salvated if there are datasets already maintained (like KEGG for pathways and NCBI for aggregates information) that could stustain them.

1. Can pathways offer semantic information about the occurences of protein aggregates?
- Assign to each pathway node a cytotoxity occurence depending on the aggregates observed, starting from the root +
  - What are the primary cytotoxic pathways for aggregates?
- Represent aggregates cytotoxicity vs pathways in an awesome visualization +
- Use information from local pathway nodes about cytotoxic compounds that can generate such events (-> induce spatial correlation)? +
  - Use protein aggregates phenomena to discover novel pathways interaction +++
  - Are AlphaFold structure predictions confirmed by the retrieved relationships for uncharted proteins? ++++
- Can we discover the primary candidates for protein aggregation during the different cell cycle stages? (scRNA needed) ++


2. Is there a sort of evolutionary control over protein aggregates?
- Discover model organisms whose human homologs exhibit protein aggregates probability of occurence at a lesser degree (blend evolution with malfunctioning processes) ++
  - Offer a tree based pathway evolution approach on the possible mutations that may have occured that caused higher probability of protein aggregation ++
- What are the non highly conserved loci that are affected by protein aggregation when looking at the human clade? ++

3. Can AlphaFold be used to increase the accuracy of discovering aggregate regions from DNA regions?


4. What about drug discovery?
- Can we find Chemicals that seem to bind to specific proteins that form aggregates by using Deep Learning techniques? ++ https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/6/830/5929692
  - Based on that analysis, can we discover chemical compounds that have low toxicology on Model Organisms other than humans? ++
